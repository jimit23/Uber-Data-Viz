# Uber-Data-Viz
Quick exploratory visualization of Uber NYC pickups data.

This short exercise reads all Uber pickups between April 2014 and September 2014, and produces an animation that shows how the pickup demands change temporally and spatially. This is done on a weekly resolution.

This simple visualization can be used to make high-level inferences such as demand being high during certain weeks in certain areas.
